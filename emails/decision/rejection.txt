Dear {{PERSON_FIRST_NAME}},

Thank you for your interest in the {{POSITION}} position at {{ORGANIZATION_SHORT_NAME}} and for the time you invested in our application process.

After careful consideration, we have decided not to move forward with your application at this time. This occasionally happens when we have a large number of highly qualified candidates, and we can only select a limited number to advance to the next stage. Please know that this does not reflect on your qualifications or potential.

We genuinely appreciate the effort you put into your application, and while you may have not secured a placement this time, we encourage you to sign up for our Talent Network at http://alterna.dev/volunteer#talent-network to be notified of future opportunities.

We wish you the very best in your career journey and future endeavours.

If you have any questions, please contact us at {{SUPPORT_EMAIL}}.
